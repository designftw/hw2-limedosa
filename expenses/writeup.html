	<center><h1>Differences between spreadsheet and spreadsheet-like app</h1></center>
<p>
	The difference is that this app aims to split the costs of every single item no matter who paid for it. The main issue with the original spreadsheet is being able to understand everything, and thus this spreadsheet allows for the splitting of all bills and the simplification of the spreadsheet.
